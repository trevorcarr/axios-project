This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is a simple blog-style type project. It has minimal styling and instead  I am focusing on how to use the Axios plugin (https://github.com/axios/axios) with React. 

Some main takeaways that I learned during this project:
* Understanding Http requests in React
* Creating requests to GET data
* Rendering data
* Transforming data
* Fetching data on update
* POSTing data to server
* DELETE data on request
* Handling Axios errors
* Adding interceptors
* Global configuration for Axios
